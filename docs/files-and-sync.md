# Files, full-text, sync, groups & export

M4 rounds out library coverage with five tools; `zotero_attach_file` and `zotero_annotate` were added later and write through the Zotero desktop app when one is reachable, falling back to the cloud Web API when it is not.

## `zotero_groups`
Lists the group libraries your key can access (id, name, type, item count, edit permissions). Pass a returned id as `library_id` (with `library_type:"group"`) to other tools to operate on a group library. `library_type` alone does not address a group: without an id the call is refused rather than falling back to your personal library.

With no key at all it lists the groups a running Zotero 10+ desktop app holds, since those are exactly the ones you can still read. The desktop serves a group's `id`, `name` and `description` plus its own item count, which counts child attachments, notes and trashed items; it does not store `type` or `libraryEditing`, so those are absent from such rows rather than guessed. Where a key and a desktop app are both present the two lists merge into one row per group, each marked `source: "cloud"`, `"local"` or `"both"`.

Reading a group needs the key to have *read* access to it (or a Zotero 10+ desktop app that holds the group, which serves reads with no key at all). **Writing** to one always goes to the cloud Web API and needs a key with write access to that group, whatever the desktop app is doing: see [Group libraries](./writing.md#group-libraries).

## `zotero_export`
Exports items in a machine-readable bibliographic format and returns the raw text:
`bibtex`, `biblatex`, `ris`, `csljson`, `csv`, `mods`, `tei`, `coins`, `rdf_bibliontology`, `rdf_dc`, `rdf_zotero`, `refer`, `wikipedia`, `bookmarks`. Narrow with `item_keys`, `collection_key`, `q`, or `item_type`. A `limit` is always applied (export formats require it). For styled, human-readable citations in a CSL style (APA, IEEE, …), use the citation tools.

## `zotero_fulltext`
Read or write attachment full text (only attachment items have it):
- `get` — extracted text + indexing stats (`found:false` when none).
- `set` — store extracted text (`content` + char/page counts).
- `since` — map of attachment keys whose full text changed after a library version (for incremental indexing).

> `get` and `since` are **routed** like every other read: Zotero 7+ serves the same `/fulltext` endpoints from the desktop app, so they need no cloud key when it is running. Group libraries, and everything when the app is closed, go to the cloud Web API. `set` is a write and always goes to the cloud.

## `zotero_sync`
The version-based delta the Zotero sync algorithm uses. Given `since` (a library version, 0 = everything), returns per-type maps of changed keys (items/collections/searches/tags) plus the deletion log. Fetch only the changed keys afterward — don't re-pull the whole library.

> **Routed**, like every other read, and `backend` says which API answered. The whole delta comes from that one API: the desktop app and the cloud number their library versions independently, so a `since` taken from one means nothing to the other. The desktop app serves item and collection versions with no cloud key; it serves no tag versions and keeps no deletion log, and those are reported in `unavailable` (with the reason and where the answer does live) rather than as empty maps. A call whose every requested part is one the desktop app lacks returns an error instead. To get those parts, read the library from the cloud: a key in `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, and `ZOTEUS_LOCAL=off` if the desktop app is running.

## `zotero_attachment`
Upload, download, or inspect attachment files. File bytes go to/from **disk**, never through the conversation.
- `upload` — store a file via the full 5-step Zotero File Storage protocol (compute md5/mtime → request authorization → upload bytes → register). Give `url` to have Zoteus fetch the file itself, or `file_path` for a file on the machine running Zoteus. Optional `parent_item`, `title`, `content_type`. Returns the new attachment key (and whether the file already existed in storage).
- `download` — fetch an attachment's file to `save_path` (default under the Zoteus data dir); returns the path and byte count. A `save_path` you name will not silently replace a file that is already there: pass `overwrite: true` if that is what you want. The default location is exempt, being Zoteus's own cache for that attachment key.
- `info` — return an attachment item's metadata, plus `localPath`: the file's absolute path on the machine running Zoteus (`<ZOTERO_DATA_DIR>/storage/<key>/<filename>` for a stored file, the recorded path for a linked one) and `localPathExists`. That is the path to hand to another program, an OCR tool say, that takes a file rather than text. `item_key` may also be a **parent** item key, which resolves to its best readable attachment (a PDF first, then an EPUB). A remote caller gets no path: on a shared deployment it would name the operator's disk.

> Uploads/downloads use the cloud Web API and count against your Zotero file-storage quota. For a **key-free** store into the running desktop app, use `zotero_attach_file` instead.
>
> `file_path` is a path on the machine running **Zoteus**, not the machine you are chatting from. On a remote or hosted server those are different machines, so use `url` there.
>
> On a server with OAuth enabled, Zoteus **enforces** that rather than leaving it to the caller: `file_path`, `save_path` and `vocabulary_path` must resolve inside the data directory, and anything else is refused. A caller-supplied path on a shared instance addresses the operator's disk, which is where the token store and the server's own code live. A local stdio install is unaffected, since there the caller already owns the machine.

## `zotero_attach_file`
Store a file as a stored attachment under an existing item. Give `parent` (the item key) and either `url` (Zoteus downloads it, then stores it) or `path` (a file on the machine running Zoteus); `filename` and `content_type` are inferred when omitted, `title` defaults to the filename. arXiv-style URLs carry no extension, so one is appended from the served content type. Returns the new attachment key.

Two backends, picked per call:

- **Desktop** (Zotero 10+ local-API writes) whenever the app is reachable: no cloud key, no storage quota, and the bytes never go through the Web API. Stored as `imported_file`.
- **Cloud** (the Web API's File Storage protocol) otherwise, or for a group library via `library_id`. Needs `ZOTERO_API_KEY` with file access and counts against your Zotero storage quota. A downloaded file is stored as `imported_url` keeping its source URL, which is what Zotero itself records for a PDF pulled off the web.

On Zotero 9 and earlier (a read-only local API) the desktop attempt fails before anything is created, so the call retries on the cloud when a key is configured. A failure *after* the attachment item exists is reported instead of retried, since a second attempt would leave the empty first one behind.

> **Remote and hosted servers.** The desktop local API listens on `127.0.0.1:23119` on **your** machine, so a Zoteus running anywhere else has no route to it and no amount of granting write access in Zotero will change that. There, the cloud path is the only one, and `url` is the way in: the server fetches the bytes itself rather than needing a file on its own disk. See [`writing.md`](./writing.md) for the desktop write paths and the one-time key grant.

## `zotero_annotate`
Add or delete Zotero PDF annotations (highlights, underlines, notes), the same objects the PDF reader creates, so they appear in Zotero's reader sidebar and export with the item. `parent` may be a regular item key (the PDF child is resolved for you) or an attachment key. Highlights need only `text`, the passage itself: Zoteus locates it in the PDF and computes the page rects Zotero anchors a highlight by, following it across line and column breaks. An explicit `position` (`{"pageIndex":N,"rects":[[x1,y1,x2,y2],…]}` in native PDF points, bottom-left origin) overrides that. `annotationSortIndex` is derived from wherever the passage lands. `action:"delete"` trashes annotations by key. Routes to the desktop app for the personal library, else the cloud Web API. Details and examples in [`writing.md`](./writing.md).

> Anchoring needs the PDF bytes, which come from the same three sources `zotero_get_fulltext` uses: the running desktop app, the local Zotero storage folder, then a cloud download. See [`grounding.md`](./grounding.md#where-the-file-bytes-come-from).
